## The Best Major League Baseball Players by Decade
In this project, I use D3 and SVG to present the best MLB baseball players of each decade. Statistics are only limited to the decade being displayed, and there are players who are present in multiple decades. I am still updating this project,and have to implement design choices concerning enter, update, and exit. But this is a good example of some of the core functionality I learned about D3, as well as ES6 and Webpack. Not currently optimized for mobile.
